# Welcome to GraphiQL

# GraphiQL is an in-browser tool for writing, validating, and
# testing GraphQL queries.

# Type queries into this side of the screen, and you will see intelligent
# typeaheads aware of the current GraphQL type schema and live syntax and
# validation errors highlighted within the text.

# with a # are ignored.

#    {
#      aws(config: {accessKeyId: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX", secretAccessKey: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX", region: "eu-west-1"}) {
#        ec2 {
#          describeInstances {
#            Reservations {
#              Instances {
#                InstanceId
#                PublicIpAddress
#                VpcId
#              }
#            }
